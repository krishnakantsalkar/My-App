  has now reached June update ....
  This time around I figured I'd add a somewhat controversial feature which was apparantly the meme-theme of this month.
  'Tik-Tok' blocker...
  While so many users loved the implementation (credits to its creator!) there was a negative reaction
  by many of the users, which was kind of the point!, continuing on the shennanigans...
  new kernel upstream for msm 4.4 completely derped the DTS eagle implementation. Build was still good to go!

  What is Python? Executive Summary
  
  Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
  Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development,
  as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 
  Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
  Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.
  
  The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, 
  and can be freely distributed.

  Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.
  Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast.
  Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. 
  Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, 
  the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables,
  evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. 
  The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power.
  On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements
  to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

  As the Coronavirus cases continue to climb in India, 
  Lockdown is lifted and we the citizens are left to fend for themselves against the deadly disease. 

  The nature of citizens of India doesnt allow anything to stop them unless forced upon. 
  No one seems to follow the prevention guidelines. Government may benefit from the medical costs of the virust toll ,
  But thats just what I think. what you think? 
  
  Indians can now dine out, shop in malls and pray at religious sites for the first time in nearly 2 1/2 months. 
  But masks or face coverings are mandatory and visitors will be thermally screened at entrances.
  The easing of restrictions ‚Äî the most significant since India went under lockdown in March ‚Äî comes as 
  the country records its biggest spike so far in new coronavirus cases in a single day.
  India counted 9,983 new infections Monday, with its overall tally crossing 250,000. The death toll stands at 7,200.
  Over the weekend, India surpassed Spain in the number of infections and became the fifth-worst affected country in the world.
  Guided by little boxes painted on floors to maintain social distancing, worshippers offered prayers at 
  mosques, temples and other religious sites across India. 
  
  But the faithful are not allowed to touch any idols or holy books. Sprinkling of sacred water, a common practice in many religions including Hinduism and Christianity, is also banned. 
  People going to mosques have to bring their own prayer mats.
  One shopping mall in the capital New Delhi has installed a sanitization enclosure at the entrance, spraying 
  disinfectant mist when someone walks in. While most public places are open in Delhi, hotels remain closed to be available in case they are needed to serve as temporary hospitals.
  Even though malls are open, gaming arcades and movie theaters inside them are still closed. 
  In some states, shoppers are barred from trying on clothes and guests checking in to hotels have to report 
  their travel and medical history.

  India's lockdown, the largest in the world, was imposed in late March when the country had just over 500 COVID-19 cases.
  About 100 million Indians have lost their jobs since then, prompting the government to reopen the economy 
  even though scientists say the country is still far from reaching its peak infection rate.
  Schools and colleges remain shut nationwide.

  After a whole week of rigorous testing, this 2nd half of 
  the month I was able to push yet another update ..
  
  In May update touch screen gestures were added , but because the source was broken that came out as huge issue soon 
  after its release 
  This time a "New implementation" based on Lineage OS touch hals was added!
  
  This took quite some time to fix, test and release give the HUGE size of the rom (1.0GB~)

  Adding tiktok blocker was great, but then again this thing becomes a responsibility as a maintainer.
  Hence it was removed in today's update!
